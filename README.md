# Real-Time-MaskDetection

This project involves a deep learning model trained on a specific dataset to detect whether a face mask is being worn in real-time. The system captures live video input and determines:

1-If a face mask is worn or not.
2-Whether the mask is worn properly or improperly.

The model utilizes state-of-the-art object detection techniques such as SSD and YOLO, ensuring accurate and efficient detection. The project is designed for real-time applications, making it suitable for deployment in various environments, including public spaces and workplaces.
